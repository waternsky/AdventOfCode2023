# AOC 2023

* This repo contains the problems that i solved in AOC 2023.
* I am using AOC 2023 to learn Go language. 

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

First problem was simple, was able to solve it in about ~ 25 mins.
Second problem was headache, it took me 12 incorrect answer submission to finish it.
Checking the parsing string took longer than expected "twone", "7nineight", "2exf" few example checks.

## Day 2: Cube Conundrum

Both the problems were pretty straight forward, was able to finish both within 2hr.
First problem in ~ 1hr 30 min & Second one in ~ 20 mins. Rank was around ~ 14k / 70k (top 20%).
